# Patient Treatment Classification using Supervised Learning Algorithms

This project was create with the aim of comparing the highest level of accuracy of the several algorithms used. The algorithms used in this experiment is Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Ensemble Stacking, and Ensemble Vote.

Another some information is number of rows and columns in dataset. The dataset have 4.412 records and 11 columns. The name of columns is:

1. HAEMATOCRIT: Patient laboratory test result of haematocrit.
2. HAEMOGLOBINS: Patient laboratory test result of haemoglobins.
3. ERYTHROCYTE: Patient laboratory test result of erythrocyte.
4. LEUCOCYTE: Patient laboratory test result of leucocyte.
5. THROMBOCYTE: Patient laboratory test result of thrombocyte.
6. MCH: Patient laboratory test result of MCH.
7. MCHC: Patient laboratory test result of MCHC.
8. MCV: Patient laboratory test result of MCV.
9. AGE: Patient age.
10. SEX: Patient gender.
11. SOURCE: The class target/dependent variable. In = in care patient, out = out care patient.
